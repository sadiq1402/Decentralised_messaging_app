We are **TokenTitans**, a team working on a cutting-edge problem statement for a hackathon: building a **Decentralized Messaging App** with a strong emphasis on security and privacy. Our app incorporates the following key technologies:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensuring that only the communicating users can read the messages.
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**: Providing decentralized identity management for secure access.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Adding privacy to sensitive data without revealing the data itself.
- **Anonymity**: Guaranteeing user anonymity while messaging.
- **Metadata Privacy**: Protecting against metadata leakage, ensuring full privacy in communication.

### Tech Stack:
- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contracts that form the backbone of our decentralized app.
- **React**: Powering the frontend for a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Anvil & Hardhat**: Used for testing, deploying, and managing the development environment.

Our project showcases the power of decentralized technologies in the realm of secure communication, providing a messaging app that users can trust with their privacy.
